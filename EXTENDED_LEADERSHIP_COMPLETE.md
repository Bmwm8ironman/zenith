# Extended Club Leadership Roles - Implementation Complete

## ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

### Problem
The club home page was only showing basic leadership (coordinators, co-coordinators, secretaries) but missing important roles like mentor, outreach, technical_guide, and event_incharge.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated Database Hierarchy**: Moved specialist leadership roles from hierarchy 5 to hierarchy 4
2. **Extended API Filter**: Updated the API to include hierarchy 4 positions
3. **Added Technical Guide Role**: Created new technical_guide positions as examples

### Files Modified

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
**Script**: `update_leadership_hierarchy.sql`
```sql
UPDATE club_members 
SET hierarchy = 4 
WHERE role IN ('mentor', 'outreach', 'technical_guide', 'event_incharge', 'media')
  AND is_current_term = true;
```

#### 2. API Filter Update
**File**: `/src/app/api/teams/club/[teamId]/route.ts`
```sql
-- BEFORE
AND cm.hierarchy <= 3

-- AFTER  
AND cm.hierarchy <= 4
```

#### 3. Sample Data Addition
**Script**: `add_technical_guides.sql` - Added technical_guide roles to demonstrate functionality

### New Leadership Hierarchy Structure

#### Hierarchy 1: Top Leadership
- **Coordinators** - Overall club leadership

#### Hierarchy 2: Deputy Leadership  
- **Co-Coordinators** - Deputy leaders and support

#### Hierarchy 3: Administrative Leadership

- **Media Heads** - Communications and media

#### Hierarchy 5: Regular Members
