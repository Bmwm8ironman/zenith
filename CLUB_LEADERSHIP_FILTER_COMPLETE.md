# Club Leadership Display Filter - Implementation Complete

## ✅ COMPLETED CHANGES

### Problem
The club home page (`/homeclub/[clubId]`) was showing all club members instead of just the leadership team, which cluttered the display with regular members and students.

### Solution Implemented
Modified the API endpoint that feeds the `TeamShowcase` component to only return leadership positions.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/app/api/teams/club/[teamId]/route.ts`
**Change**: Added hierarchy filter to only show leadership positions
```sql
-- BEFORE
WHERE cm.club_id = $1 
  AND cm.hierarchy IS NOT NULL

-- AFTER  
WHERE cm.club_id = $1 
  AND cm.hierarchy IS NOT NULL
  AND cm.hierarchy <= 3
```

### Leadership Hierarchy Structure
Based on the database analysis:
- **Hierarchy 1**: Coordinators 
- **Hierarchy 2**: Co-Coordinators
- **Hierarchy 3**: Secretaries
- **Hierarchy 4+**: Regular members, core members, active members (now filtered out)

### Impact
- ✅ Club home pages now only display leadership team (coordinators, co-coordinators, secretaries)
- ✅ Regular members and students are no longer shown in the public-facing team showcase
- ✅ Leadership carousel is cleaner and more focused
- ✅ Change applies to all clubs automatically via the shared API endpoint

### Technical Details
- **Component**: `TeamShowcase` at `/components/TeamShowcase.tsx`
- **Usage**: Club home page at line 470+ in `/app/homeclub/[clubId]/page.tsx`
- **API**: `/api/teams/club/[teamId]` - fetches team data for the showcase
- **Query**: Filters `club_members` table by `hierarchy <= 3` to show only leadership

### Verification
The change affects the data returned by the API, so:
1. Club leadership carousel will now show fewer members
2. Only coordinators, co-coordinators, and secretaries will be displayed
3. Regular members, core members, and active members are filtered out
4. The change is automatic and applies to all clubs using the TeamShowcase component

## 🎯 Result
Club home pages now provide a clean, focused view of club leadership without overwhelming visitors with the full member roster, while maintaining a professional presentation of the team structure.
